LISA Sprint 2024 project on distinguishing glitches from GW bursts

## Monday Plenary
GW bursts vs glitches: how do you distinguish them?
* Astrophysical vs instrumental signal â†’ does it have a sky location?

Reproduce results from Cornish 2019
- non-ringing LPF-like glitches
- different GW bursts models (e.g. highly eccentric binaries (Xuan 2024))

## Tuesday Plenary
Analysis of bursts & glitches
- Chat with Xuan/Smadar about burst models
- Chat with Neil about bayesian analysis of bursts/glitches
- Setting up the sampler

## Wednesday morning
### Conversatin with Zeyuan Xhan
- Periodic bursts from highly eccentric binaries
    - Depending on the binary parameters it can be a sharper Sine-Gaussian or a single-sided bursts
    - The Sine-Gaussian is a good approximation for a toy model
- Periodicity of the bursts:
    - ranging from a few hours to up to a month
    - the peak of the distribution is ~ day
- Amplitude of the bursts in strain:
    - ~ 1e-21
- The periodic burst in strain is either $h_+$ or $h_\times$ or the combination $h_+ + i h_\times$.
- Unsure about the fraction of systems that might give rise to these bursts --> not sure about the amount of events LISA might get.
