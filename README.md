LISA Sprint 2024 project on distinguishing glitches from GW bursts

## Monday Plenary
GW bursts vs glitches: how do you distinguish them?
* Astrophysical vs instrumental signal â†’ does it have a sky location?

Reproduce results from Cornish 2019
- non-ringing LPF-like glitches
- different GW bursts models (e.g. highly eccentric binaries (Xuan 2024))

## Tuesday Plenary
Analysis of bursts & glitches
- Chat with Xuan/Smadar about burst models
- Chat with Neil about bayesian analysis of bursts/glitches
- Setting up the sampler
